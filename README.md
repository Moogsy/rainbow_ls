# Rainbow-ls
ls, but with more colors

TODO:
  - Rotate the output 90Â° to the left
  - Cleanup
  - Command line args 
  - Option to change the highlighting that gets used (bold/invert/...) via command line args
  - Same for the colour modifier
  - Screenshots for symlinks and unknown ?
  - Add some kind of way to highlight executables

Some screenshots before colors are cool:
